# Data & Models (Depending on if you want to commit them)
# In this case, we might want to keep reference.csv but ignore others?
# Usually data/ and models/ are ignored and handled via DVC or similar.
# But for this demo, they might be needed.
# I'll ignore current.csv since it's generated during simulation.
